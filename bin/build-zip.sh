# Packages this child theme into a clean, installable .zip for upload to
# Warden as a release of this client's own track.
#
# Much simpler than the parent theme's equivalent, because a child theme
# has none of the things that make that one complicated: no vendor/, no
# Composer, no test suite, no release gate. It's this client's own code and
# nothing else.
#
# The theme slug is read from the DIRECTORY NAME rather than hardcoded, so
# a renamed copy of this starter ("duplicate both, rename the child for the
# client") packages correctly with no edit to this script. The zip's
# top-level folder is what WordPress installs the theme as, and it must
# keep matching the directory name on disk, or an update would install
# alongside the existing copy instead of replacing it.
